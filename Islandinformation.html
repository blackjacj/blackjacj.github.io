                <h2>To the island</h2>
                <p>Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small 
                    cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti
                    is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller
                    planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger
                    jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.</p>
                <h2>Ground Transportation</h2>
                <p>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. 
                    Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti 
                    City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the 
                    airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors 
                    (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable
                    . Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area 
                    is easy to explore on foot.</p>

            <p>Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, 
                and to visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do.
                Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly
